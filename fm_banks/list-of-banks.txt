This is a directory that contains bank files used during the building of the
inst_db.cpp database of embedded banks for libADLMIDI. This file explains
what each bank is and its origins.

Many of these banks are often modifications over MT32-style example bank that
appears in the open-source release of AIL library by John Miles with the custom

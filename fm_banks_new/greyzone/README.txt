Here are banks based on the content picked-up without explicit permission of
their authors. These banks awaiting for their clarification of the legal status.

Their usage terms are unclear. From the one side, nobody cares about these banks
and the copyright status is vague once it comes to the sets of 11-byte numbers
combo. From the another side, the legal status must be clarified for these banks
so nobody have questions especially from the side of the Debian project where
copyright question is taken seriously.

Once any author of each bank will explicitly grant the suitable license, they
will be moved to the general directory.
------------
And so, until these banks will be fully clarified, there are temporary 
replacements provided in the "alt" directory that will take places of these
banks until they will be fully clarified.
